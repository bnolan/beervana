Back To Black,Fork Brewing,Black Saison,5.2,Brewers Gold,70,B123,"Chocolate and spice and all things nice. A little twist on the broad Belgian Saison style with a sprinkling of the enigmatic Grains of Paradise, a couple of yeast strains and a blend of pale and dark malts. Caramel chocolate and fruity esters leap into the nose, following through into the palate where warming alcohol and a dry finish combine with surprising body and a peppery post-script."
Base Jumper,Fork Brewing,APA,6.3,Bullion,82,B22,"Grab a bunch of American and New Zealand hops with names like Zythos, Cascade and Motueka, add liberally to a base of bold ale malt, throw in a little crystal malt goodness, shake until just right, adjust your parachute and sip away at a pint as you jump from a cliff. "

Low Blow,Fork Brewing,Sesion IPA,4.7,Challenger,97,JKJ132,"The 'flavour du jour', a lovely lower strength IPA bursting with piney bitterness, hints of gooseberry and kiwifruit and a grapefruit zest back palate.

Ring the bell for the next round!"
Parleyer Pilsner,Funk Estate,Pilsner,4.9,Chinook,54,C234,"This cheeky little pilsner is sure to fuel the good times and get you parleying Funk Style.

Pale Ale,Hop Federation Brewery,Ale,5.1,(Tomahawk),38,F185,"Golden in colour and light in character, our delicious Pale Ale will win you over from the start with its tropical fruit aromas. These carry through to the palate, where they combine with hints of grapefruit and pine, enhancing its crisp fruitiness. Pale Ale’s distinct hoppy flavour comes from a judicious blend of four local hop varieties, and the two selected Gladfield malts from Canterbury contribute to its appealing colour. Its clean, fresh eagerness is tempered by a subtle sweetness and rounded off with a satisfying, lasting finish. A youthful member of the large, wide-ranging family of pale ales, this is one of our most-popular beers."
Red IPA,Hop Federation Brewery,IPA,6.4,Comet,79,A194,"This India Pale Ale is a descendant of a tradition with deep colonial roots, stretching back several centuries to when pale ales were boosted with hops and alcohol to withstand the long sea voyage from England to India. With predominantly local hops, Gladfield malts from Canterbury and slightly above-average alcohol content, our Red IPA has the same confidence and individuality that characterise our own former colony. Tantalising passionfruit aromas give way to a delightful and unexpected combination of berries, tart ruby grapefruit and a comforting toasty malt on the palate, rounded off with a satisfying, sustained finish."
Kauri Falls Pale Ale,Hot Water Brewing Co,Pale Ale,5.2,Nelson Sauvin and Riwaka hops.,88,N1953,Balanced with enough malt character from the English pale and caramalt to carry the fruity Kiwi hop hit.

Pale Ale,North End Brewery,Pale Ale,6.6,First Gold,55,H512,"Fieldway combines 3 different fruity New Zealand grown hop varieties to create complex aromas and flavours of sweet lemon, lime, and mandarin marmalade with a hint of the herb garden"
E.S.B,North End Brewery,Pale Ale,5.56,Fuggles,78,Z122,"Our Extra Special Bitter takes the classic malty, fruity London style of pale ale and injects a dose of zesty locally grown hops.

Hoppy Wheat,North End Brewery,Wheat,2.2,Galena,31,Q132,"Hoppy Wheat is a modern type of wheat beer that combines fruity New Zealand Hop varieties with crisp, tart wheat malt to create a refreshing complex golden beer. The result takes the best elements of an ‘American Wheat Ale’ and fuses them to best elements of a ‘New Zealand Pilsner’"
Gisborne Gold,Sunshine Brewery,NZ Lager,4,Glacier,66,L199,"Born of sun, sea and hot afternoons, Gizzy Gold, as it’s known locally, is our classic thirst quenching and award winning session lager. Dry, crisp and refreshing, it has a lightly toasted maltiness over a solid Green Bullet hop backbone."
Gisborne Pilsner,Sunshine Brewery,NZ Pilsner,5,"Goldings, B. C.",55,O112,Grab a Gisborne Pilsner before loosening your tie after a hard day at the office or to get you in the zone before lighting the BBQ. This beer has the same trademark dry and crisp finish of Gizzy Gold but it’s brewed bigger for a heavier hop hit. Its citrus aroma and palette of tropical fruit and grapefruit is held together by a big toasty all malt sweetness. Motueka and Green Bullet hops play against each other in each savoury mouthful. Expect to want more.
Gunnamatta,Yeastie Boys,India Pale Ale,6.5,"Goldings, East Kent (EK)",12,H11,"Champion Beer, Great Australasian Beer SpecTAPular 2012 -- Gold, Brewers Guild of New Zealand Awards 2013. A modern cult classic inspired by the Pale Ales that travelled from England to the East Indies and, perhaps more importantly, all that precious tea that returned on those same ships. Yeastie Boys' Gunnamatta utilises judicious amounts of Earl Grey Blue Flower tea to generate an intoxicating floral and citrus aroma with the quenching dry finish of an ice tea. A truly unique new world India Pale Ale with a decidedly old world twist."
Minimatta,Yeastie Boys,Session IPA,4,Green Bullet,66,FG123,"A tea-ny tiny session IPA inspired by the common complaint of Gunnamatta drinkers that “I just wish I could find some way of drinking more of the stuff”. We slashed the booze, halved the tea, and doubled the puns to create that perfect sessionable balance desired by a crowd during a week of good beer. Heirloom orange and floral notes entice you in on the nose, and are followed by a clean malt profile carrying a hint of tropical fruit, before giving way to the fresh hop finish and lengthy floral tea notes on the palate."
Rex attitude,Yeastie Boys,Peat-smoked Strong Golden Ale,7,Hallertauer,37,D123,"Morton Coutts Trophy for Innovation, Brewers Guild of New Zealand Awards 2011. The world's first heavily-peated single malt ale. Rex Attitude is a deceptively innocuous game changing beer that is possibly the smokiest in the world, certainly one of the most polarising, and yet very delicate and beguilingly drinkable for those who get past the initial shock. The favourite beer of both Yeastie Boys, it was infamously described as “like tonguing your grandad!”"
The Last Dictator,Yeastie Boys,Botrytised Imperial Porter,10,Hallertauer,92,D321,"The Spoonbender series is a celebration of the strange things that happen when weird brewers meet even weirder folk from other industries. In this inaugural Spoonbender series, the Yeastie Boys team up with Some Young Punk to create beers built around some of the Punks’ aged botrytised Viognier. To drink this wine inside a beer, this fungus within a fungus, is a welcome surprise… the vines and fields no longer recognise their fruit."
Paw Paw Blowtorch,Yeastie Boys,Transpacific Mild Ale,4.5,Hersbrucker,55,K11,"Great Australasian SpecTAPular Festival 2014. After breaking new ground with the award-winning Gunnamatta, and then confusing all comers with scarily blood red Golden Age of Bloodshed, the Yeastie Boys are back at it with their 2014 GABS release. This year we’re encouraging you to dive into this dark and steamy Brian Eno inspired pyrokinetic mild ale. An understated session beer that reveals hints of tropical fruit, heat, and smoke to the thoughtful drinker… yet is drinkable enough for any punters session. Like many of our beers, the Blowtorch finishes with a lingering mountain of myth."
Sun before darkness,Yeastie Boys,Botrytised Tripel,10,Hallertauer,67,EF88,"The Spoonbender series is a celebration of the strange things that happen when weird brewers meet even weirder folk from other industries.

White noise,Yeastie Boys,Belgian-style Witbier,4.2,Cluster,564,FF0001,"Pours a cloudy pale straw colour with a mousse-like white head. A perfumy coconut note on the nose, with a little spice and bready grains from the wheat, evokes the last hints of summer. The mouthfeel is quite full, for such a pale beer, and the beer but finishes with a cleansing acidity, a faint spicy note and only the mildest touch of citrus from the almost non-existent hops."
